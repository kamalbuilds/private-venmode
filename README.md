This setup allows private onchain transactions, ensuring that only the sender and the receiver are aware of the transaction details.

## Introduction

PrivateVenmode leverages the Mode blockchain to offer a unique suite of features aimed at transforming how we send gifts and make donations in the cryptocurrency space. Mode's security is powered by a decentralized network of Orchestrators and the Spiderchain's multisig technology, ensuring every transaction is secure and reliable.


### What is FHE?

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it first. This means data can be manipulated and processed in its encrypted form, maintaining confidentiality throughout the entire computation process. FHE operates using advanced mathematical concepts from algebraic geometry, number theory, and lattice-based cryptography, enabling secure and private data operations.

## Features

- **Time-Locked Gifts**: Schedule your gifts to be unlocked at a future date, adding excitement to birthdays, anniversaries, and special occasions.
- **Gift Claim Codes**: Send a gift anonymously or surprise someone with a claim code that unlocks a special token gift.
- **Recurring Gifts**: Set up continuous joy by scheduling recurring gifts, ensuring your loved ones or favorite charities receive regular support.
- **Charity Donations**: Support verified charities directly within the Mode ecosystem, leveraging blockchain technology's security and transparency.
- **Decentralized and Secure**: Built on the Layer 3 chain, PrivateVenmode ensures decentralization and security with multisig wallets and a network of Orchestrators overseeing every transaction.
- **Encrypted Messaging**: Send encrypted messages on the Layer 3 chain utilizing FHE technology powered by Inco, Hyperlane, and Kurtosis.

### Bridging the Cyphertext

- **Efficiency**: Bridging the ciphertext directly across chains takes approximately 1/3 of an ETH block. But we Innovated and utilsie the off-chain oracle to accomplish very low cost privacy enable encrypted transactions for the L3 Rollup.
- **Process**: Convert ciphertext to hash and bridge that  from L-3 chain to Inco and use the off-chain oracle to decrypt it and recrypt it.
