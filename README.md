## Introduction

At its core, PrivateVenmode leverages the Mode blockchain to offer a unique suite of features aimed at transforming how we think about sending gifts and making donations in the cryptocurrency space. With Mode's unparalleled security, powered by a decentralized network of Orchestrators and the Spiderchain's multisig technology, your transactions are not just transactions—they're a new form of connecting, giving, and supporting causes and individuals across the globe.

Fully Homomorphic encryption (FHE) is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without first having to decrypt it. In simpler terms, it enables data to be manipulated and processed in its encrypted form, maintaining its confidentiality throughout the entire computation process.

FHE operates using mathematical concepts from algebraic geometry, number theory, and lattice-based cryptography. The basic idea behind FHE is to use mathematical structures that allow operations to be performed on encrypted data in a way that, when decrypted, produce the same result as if the operations were performed on the original unencrypted data.
